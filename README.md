## What is this and who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I develop Websites in ReactJs and TailwindCSS, and this is a showcase product I've built in my spare time. It's a very good example of modern, real-world React codebase.

There are many showcase/example React projects out there but most of them are way too simple. I like to think that this codebase contains enough complexity to offer valuable insights to React developers of all skill levels while still being _relatively_ easy to understand.

## Features

- Proven, scalable, and easy to understand project structure
- Written in modern React, only functional components with hooks
- Fully Responsive
- Simple local React state management - useState()
- Custom webpack setup, without create-react-app or similar
- Navigation Links hover effects
- Modern Navigation Bar
- Products Infinite Scroll

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- Make sure you have nodejs installed on your system
- `git clone https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone.git`
- On the terminal, make user you are in the cloned folder dir and run `npm install`
- App should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`
- Navigate through the app.

## What's missing?

There are features missing from this showcase product which should exist in a real product:

## Contributing

This is a showcase product, and so I will not be accepting any contributes. Feel free to fork and work, and maintain your own version.
